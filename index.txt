Thus to scan the index for one unique entry, 
Oracle will need to read the root node to locate the correct branch node in branch level one, 
read that to find the correct branch node in branch level 2 and that will lead to the correct leaf block. 

That is four blocks to read. The leaf block contains the index entry and the rowid of the relevant data block, 
which allows oracle to go directly to that block, for the fifth block read.

I got something wrong on a couple of postings recently, namely the relationship between BLEVEL and the number of blocks needed to read “down” an index, the true depth or HEIGHT of the index {I used to know this but I forgot, but heck no one pinged me on the two posts in question, so I got away with it 🙂 – I’ve updated the postings already.}

BLEVEL is the number of branch levels (including the root node) in a B-Tree index. Height is the actual depth of the index. Height is BLEVEL plus one. So when you see BLEVEL of 3 against an index in DBA_INDEXES/DBA_IND_STATISTICS, that means the index has a root node, a first level of Branch blocks, then a second level of Branch blocks and finally the Leaf blocks (which hold the indexed values and rowids to the table entries).
